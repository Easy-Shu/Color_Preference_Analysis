# Perception and Preference Analysis of Fashion Colors: Solid Color Shirts
Consumer clothing preference research is an important part of the sustainabledevelopment of the clothing industry and it has an impact on environmental and designsustainability. Hence, a psychophysical experiment based on solid color shirts is carried out to analyze users' perceptions and preferences concerning fashion colors, including the aesthetic differencesand similarities between males and females, and establish a hierarchical feed-forward model of colorpreferences relating to solid color shirts. The full paper (with corrected figures) is provided in ((Perception and Preference Analysis of Fashion Colors: Solid Color Shirts[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332614133_Perception_and_Preference_Analysis_of_Fashion_Colors_Solid_Color_Shirts]).

The 3D charts in the paper are produced by using R packages (i.e., [plot3D](https://github.com/cran/plot3D), [colorspace](https://github.com/cran/colorspace), and [RColorBrewer](https://github.com/cran/RColorBrewer)), and other 2D charts are produced by using python packages (i.e., [plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine), [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)).
