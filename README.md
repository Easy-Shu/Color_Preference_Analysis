# Color_Preference_Analysis
Consumer clothing preference research is an important part of the sustainabledevelopment of the clothing industry and it has an impact on environmental and designsustainability. Hence, a psychophysical experiment based on solid color shirts is carried out to analyze users' perceptions and preferences concerning fashion colors, including the aesthetic differencesand similarities between males and females, and establish a hierarchical feed-forward model of colorpreferences relating to solid color shirts. 

The 3D charts in the paper are produced by using R packages (i.e., plot3D, colorspace, and RColorBrewer), and other 2D charts are produced by using python packages (i.e., [plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine), matplotlib).
